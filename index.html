    <p>I am not married. I enjoy cooking and sports, and I am a big Formula 1 fan.</p> 
    <p>  I'm a software engineering major who wants to work as a web developer.</p>
    <p>  This course will assist me in developing the skills I require as a Web Designer,</p> 
    <p>   and I hope to learn as much as possible from my instructor and peers.</p>
    <p>  I also want to be a better thinker and creator by the end of the course.</p> 
    <p>  I am a convert to the Church and have been a member since 2009.</p>
